# Tutorial AquaCrop-OSPy

* What is Aquacrop (Explain for Rossana).


* What is the purpouse of use this:
    * Improving Irrigations water efficiency.
    * Agriculture uses more freshwater globally than any other sector.
    * Increse demans on water resourses from all sectors.
    * Need to imprtove irrigation watrer efficience. 

* Introduction to crop-growth models.
    * Crop-growth models are powerful tools which simulate
    * crop growth in response to climate and management practises.
    * Many experiments are too impractical to do in an actual field.
    * Some are designed for usability and others for flexibility
    * Applications include:
    * Prediction of climate change impacts on agricultural yields and crop-water demands,
    * Evaluating irrigation management strategies.

* Introducing AquaCrop-OSPy
	* AquaCrop-OSPy is an open-source python implementation of the FAO AquaCrop model.
	* AquaCrop aims to accurately simulate crop response to water stress
	* ACOSP builds on existing implementations of AquaCrop
	* in Matlab (Foster et al, 2017) and R (Rodriguez and Ober, 2019).
	* Peer reviewed article in Agricultrual Water Management.

* What does this version have over the other:
	* Only basic Python experience required.
	* Flexible adjust model inputs and integrate with other Python modules.
	* Jupyter Notebooks Tutorials.
	* You can use Web browser without the need to localy install.

* Example of use cases: 
    * How to run first Simulation.
    * Optimization of Irrigation sheduling.
    * Irrigation decisions using Deep Reinforcement Learning.
    * Streamlit Web app.

## Install

```bash
pip install aquacrop
```
